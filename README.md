# Skip-Gram-implementation-from-scratch-
This is our Assignment for CS772: Deep Learning for NLP. The aim is to study and implement the skip gram algorithm from scratch in python.  Cluster of “animal words”: dog","tiger","cat","elephant","horse","bear","cow","monkey","deer","snake","lion" Cluster of “bird words”: sparrow","parrot","dove","eagle","woodpecker","crane","owl","duck","cuckoo","penguin" Create word clusters as mentioned above. Run a concordance for obtaining the neighboring words of these words. Train a skip-gram model with these words. Collect the word representations. Ensure that “animal” words are close to other “animal” words and so are “bird” words; Inter-cluster distance should be large compared to intra-cluster distance; use cosine similarity and other cluster-quality measures.
